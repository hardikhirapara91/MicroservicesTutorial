= Customization & Extension Guide

The following guides will help you work with and develop extensions on top of the
backend APIs and microservices framework provided with Broadleaf.

They are a great way to experience some core fundamentals before diving into more complex scenarios.

[NOTE]
====
The guides here assume you are building these customizations on a base project that has
already been set up for you. You can use `MicroservicesTutorial/ms-tutorial-base` as a base
starting point.

Also be aware that this project is set up to only load the `Catalog` microservice
alongside some core backing services and additional supporting services. Not all backend commerce APIs
are needed for the scope of this tutorial.
====

[TIP]
====
We recommend following along with this guide in the order in which it is presented. Each section
may build on and reference extensions created in a previous section.
====

== Service Anatomy Overview

Before we begin, it's best to understand the general anatomy of every Broadleaf microservice.
The diagram below provides a good high level overview depicting the different layers that a request
can go through as it flows through a particular service. The key takeaway is that that every layer
in the architecture can be customized and extended to fit unique business needs and requirements.
In these tutorials, we'll be walking you through typical customizations paths that touch some
of these different layers.

image::../images/MS_Service_Anatomy.jpg[]

== Product Repository Domain

In this section, we're going to cover how to extend the actual `Product` *repository* domain so that
we can keep track of a new attribute directly on the persisted entity.

=== Overview
Broadleaf leverages https://spring.io/projects/spring-data[Spring Data] for entity persistence.
Spring Data supports polymorphism as part of the data interaction, which facilitates standard
Java OOP extension of out-of-the-box Broadleaf repository domain classes.
Fields may be added in extensions to support additional business
requirements. Also, mutator methods can be overridden for additional customization.

Queries through existing Broadleaf repositories should return the more derived repository domain
as appropriate. As well, creation of entity state should be accurate to the more derived type.

[NOTE]
====
We're continually adding new features and capabilities to enhance the developer experience.
We recommend checking back often to see any new features and tools that will be added to
help provide a seamless customization experience.
====

=== `JpaProduct` Extension Example
We're going to create a simple `String` property on `JpaProduct` to demonstrate extending a base
framework *repository* domain.

[source,java]
----
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.provider.jpa.domain.product.JpaProduct;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Table;

import lombok.Data;
import lombok.EqualsAndHashCode;

@Entity
@Table(name = "TUTORIAL_PRODUCT")
@Data
@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = true)
public class TutorialJpaProduct extends JpaProduct {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Column(name = "MY_PROPERTY")
    private String myProperty;

}
----

Next, you'll want to inform the system of your new entity. You can do this by specifying
a `@JpaEntityScan` for your particular package. It may look something like this:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@JpaEntityScan(basePackages = "com.broadleafsamples.tutorials.services.catalog.provider.jpa.domain",
        routePackage = "com.broadleafcommerce.catalog")
@AutoConfigureAfter(CatalogJpaAutoConfiguration.class)
public class TutorialCatalogConfig {

    // other beans and configurations here

}
----

=== Adding a Liquibase Changelog
The project utilizes Liquibase to manage schema changes, so we'll need to add a new changelog for our extension
and ensure the system is aware of our changes.

We've provided a utility class that will automatically look at the state of your
current application's changelogs and generate any missing change set for you.

==== Set up your Liquibase Change Log Structure

Create a file called `catalog.tutorialdata.postgresql.changelog-master.xml` in the following
directory: `src/main/java/resources/db/changelog/`.

The contents of the file should contain this initially:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<databaseChangeLog xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog"
                   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                   xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-3.8.xsd">
    <include file="db/changelog/catalog.postgresql.changelog-master.xml" />
</databaseChangeLog>
----

==== Generate Missing Change Sets

To engage the change set generation capabilities, you will first need to create an integration
test class under `/src/test/java/com/broadleafsamples/tutorials`

Create a `UtilitiesIT` class like below:

[source,java]
----
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Nested;
import org.springframework.test.context.TestPropertySource;

import static com.broadleafcommerce.common.jpa.schema.SchemaCompatibiltyUtility.PostgresUtilityProvider;

/**
 * Verify that we can start up against RDBMS using the known schema configuration. The
 * {@code Utility} test class is intended for use by developers to keep JPA entity changes in sync
 * with the liquibase change logs.
 */
public class UtilitiesIT {

    // @formatter:off
    /**
     * Execute these utility tests directly from the IDE in order to update the liquibase
     * change logs for each supported RDBMS platform based on the current JPA entity state. Updated
     * Liquibase change logs are emitted at src/main/resources/db/changelog.
     */
    // @formatter:on
    public static class AllUtilities {

        @TestPropertySource(properties = {"spring.liquibase.enabled=false", "service.key=catalog",
                "client.prefix=tutorialdata"})
        @Nested
        public class PostgresUtility extends PostgresUtilityProvider {}

    }

}
----

Once you have this class in place, run this class in your IDE as an integration test.

This should update the file you created earlier:
`src/main/java/resources/db/changelog/catalog.tutorialdata.postgresql.changelog-master.xml`
with the missing changes that need to be applied to the DB (e.g. the `TUTORIAL_PRODUCT` table)

== Product Projection Domain
In this section, weâ€™re going to cover how to extend the Product *projection* domain so that
our new properties can be used by downstream clients and other projection domains.

=== `Product` Extension Example
As with the `TutorialJpaProduct` extension, We're going to replicate and add the same simple `String` property
to our `Product` *Projection* domain.

[source,java]
----
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.domain.product.Product;
import com.broadleafcommerce.common.extension.RequestView;
import com.broadleafcommerce.common.extension.ResponseView;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonView;
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)
@JsonView({RequestView.class, ResponseView.class})
public class TutorialProduct extends Product {

    private String myProperty;

}
----

Next, you'll want to inform the system of your new projection extension using a `TypeSupplier`.
You can do this by specifying a custom bean in your configuration:

[source,java]
----
public class TutorialCatalogConfig {

    @Bean
    public TypeSupplier tutorialProductSupplier() {
        return () -> new TypeSupplier.TypeMapping(Product.class,
                TutorialProduct.class);
    }

}
----

=== `ProductDetails` Extension Example

In some cases, you may also wish to expose your extended repository projection to other dependent projection objects. An example in the `CatalogService` would include the `ProductDetails` projection domain. This domain is used to facilitate building a product structure containing curated information needed for a typical product details page shown in a commerce-facing storefront app (as opposed to info needed to support a product management screen)

To do this, you'll want to extend the base `ProductDetails` domain like below:

[source,java]
----
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.domain.product.IncludedProduct;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.domain.product.Product;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.domain.product.commerce.ProductDetails;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.domain.product.option.ProductOption;
import com.broadleafcommerce.common.extension.ResponseView;
import com.broadleafsamples.tutorials.services.catalog.domain.product.TutorialProduct;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnoreProperties;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonView;
import java.util.List;
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.EqualsAndHashCode;
import lombok.ToString;
import lombok.experimental.Accessors;
import lombok.experimental.Delegate;

@Data
@Accessors(chain = true)
@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = true)
@ToString(callSuper = true)
@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)
@JsonIgnoreProperties({"contextState", "defaultPrice", "msrp", "salePrice"})
@JsonView({ResponseView.class})
public class TutorialProductDetails extends ProductDetails {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @JsonIgnore
    @Delegate(excludes = ExcludedProductMethods.class)
    private TutorialProduct product;

    @Override
    public void setProduct(Product product) {
        this.product = (TutorialProduct) product;
        super.setProduct(product);
    }

    @Override
    public TutorialProduct getProduct() {
        return product;
    }

    @Data
    @Accessors(chain = true)
    @AllArgsConstructor
    private abstract static class ExcludedProductMethods {
        private List<IncludedProduct> includedProducts;

        private List<ProductOption> options;

        public abstract String getMetaDescription();

        public abstract String getMetaTitle();
    }


}
----

Next, you'll want to inform the system of your new projection extension using a `TypeSupplier`.
You can do this by specifying a custom bean in your configuration:

[source,java]
----
public class TutorialCatalogConfig {

    @Bean
    public TypeSupplier tutorialProductDetails() {
        return () -> new TypeSupplier.TypeMapping(ProductDetails.class,
                TutorialProductDetails.class);
    }

}
----

== Additional Spring Components

In this section, we'll walk through extending other interesting components in the framework which
would be typical in an actual implementation.

=== Product Export Customization
We're going to extend framework's `Product` `Export Row Converter` in order to add the simple
additional property that we've added to the repository domain. This will allow
the default `Product Export` jobs to utilize the new extended attributes when producing the
`CSV` file.

[source,java]
----
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.dataexport.converter.DimensionsExportRowConverter;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.dataexport.converter.ProductExportRowConverter;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.dataexport.converter.ToStringConverter;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.dataexport.converter.WeightExportRowConverter;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.dataexport.converter.support.ConversionUtils;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.dataexport.specification.ProductExportSpecification;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.domain.product.Product;
import com.broadleafsamples.tutorials.services.catalog.provider.jpa.domain.TutorialJpaProduct;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;
import java.util.Map;

import static com.broadleafcommerce.common.extension.reflection.InvocationUtils.withExample;

public class TutorialProductExportRowConverter extends ProductExportRowConverter { // <1>


    public TutorialProductExportRowConverter(ProductExportSpecification specification,
                                             ObjectMapper objectMapper,
                                             ToStringConverter<Object> toStringConverter,
                                             DimensionsExportRowConverter dimensionsExportRowConverter,
                                             WeightExportRowConverter weightExportRowConverter) {
        super(specification, objectMapper, toStringConverter, dimensionsExportRowConverter, weightExportRowConverter);
    }

    @Override
    public LinkedHashSet<String> getHeaders() { // <2>
        LinkedHashSet<String> headers = super.getHeaders();
        headers.add(TutorialFields.MY_PROPERTY);
        return headers;
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, String> convert(Product source) {
        Map<String, String> result = super.convert(source);
        ConversionUtils.putIfNotNull(TutorialFields.MY_PROPERTY,
                ((TutorialProduct)source).getMyProperty(), result); <4>
        return result;
    }

    public static class TutorialFields {
        public static final String MY_PROPERTY = "myProperty";
    }

}
----
<1> Extend the framework's `ProductExportRowConverter`
<2> Override the `getHeaders()` method to call `super()` and define your new property
<3> Override the `convert()` method to call `super()` and define your new property
<4> Cast the `Product` projection to our extended projection to get your new property.

[TIP]
====
Broadleaf provides some shortcut extension patterns that allows "auto-generation" of projection domains. In simple cases, it may be enough to just extend the `JpaProduct` repository domain. However, in cases where you need more control of the projection object (or there are other projections that reference it) you may also need to define a `TutorialProduct extends Product` class.

In the simple cases, where Broadleaf builds the projection for you, you can utilize the
`withExample()` utility method as below:

[source,java]
----
ConversionUtils.putIfNotNull(TutorialFields.MY_PROPERTY, withExample(TutorialJpaProduct.class).andTarget(source).getMyProperty(), result);
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must still register your component with Spring either by component scanning or explicitly
defining the `@Bean` in your own configuration class e.g.

[source,java]
----
    @Bean
    public TutorialProductExportRowConverter customProductExportRowConverter(
            ProductExportSpecification specification,
            ObjectMapper objectMapper,
            ToStringConverter<Object> toStringConverter,
            DimensionsExportRowConverter dimensionsExportRowConverter,
            WeightExportRowConverter weightExportRowConverter) {
        return new TutorialProductExportRowConverter(specification,
                objectMapper,
                toStringConverter,
                dimensionsExportRowConverter,
                weightExportRowConverter);
    }
----
====

== Admin Metadata Customizations

In this section, we'll go over how to manage your simple property that you've added to
both the projection and repository domains.

==== Overview

The following diagram is a high level diagram that depicts the Metadata "Pipeline"
in which it is responsible for rendering navigation, requesting view metadata,
requesting user allowed scopes for views, requesting access tokens, rendering the view,
and finally, requesting CRUD on the domain service.

image::../images/MS_Metadata_Pipeline.png[]

1. the metadata service receives its initial set of metadata from a variety of sources
(metadata providers)

2. Each Broadleaf Microservice has a provider out-of-box, like catalog and pricing, which provide
the metadata needed for those services

3. the metadata from these providers is then stored in the metadata service

4. when the client requests metadata for a view from the REST API, the metadata is processed by
an augmentation layer before being returned to the client

[TIP]
====
this augmentation layer is another useful extension point for making modification to the metadata
before itâ€™s returned to the client
====

==== Extension Example
For this example, we'll extend the `CatalogService` default metadata provider and add a reference
to the new attribute we've added to `Product`.

In order to do this, we'll need to create a new Metadata Config class that extends some built in
product components.


[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.metadata.product.CommonPriceDataComponents;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.metadata.product.IncludedProductFields;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.metadata.product.NonSkuPriceDataComponents;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.metadata.product.ProductFields;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.metadata.product.ProductForms;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.metadata.product.ProductOptionFields;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.metadata.product.ProductOptionForms;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.metadata.product.PromotionalProductFields;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.metadata.product.VariantFields;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.metadata.product.pricing.PriceDataFields;
import com.broadleafcommerce.metadata.domain.FieldComponent;
import com.broadleafcommerce.metadata.domain.builder.EntityFormBuilder;

@Configuration
public class TutorialMetadataConfig {

    @Configuration
    public static class Catalog {

        @Bean
        public ComponentSource tutorialProductMetadataOverrides() { // <1>
            return registry -> {
                CreateEntityView<?> productCreate =
                        (CreateEntityView<?>) registry.get(ProductIds.CREATE);
                productCreate.generalForm(this::addTutorialProductFields);

                UpdateEntityView<?> productUpdate =
                        (UpdateEntityView<?>) registry.get(ProductIds.UPDATE);
                productUpdate.generalForm(this::addTutorialProductFields);
            };
        }

        protected EntityFormView<?> addTutorialProductFields(EntityFormView<?> form) { // <2>
            return form
                    .addField(TutorialProductProps.MY_PROPERTY, Fields.string()
                            .label("My Property")
                            .order(20000));
        }


    }
}
----
<1> Create a bean to override existing Catalog Metadata. Utilize the `ComponentSource` registry to get
the Product `Create` and `Update` Forms to add the custom field.
<2> Augment the existing `EntityFormView` General Form to add the new `My Property` String field.

== Customizing a Service

In this section, let's walk through customizing the service tier.

=== Overview
The service tier is responsible for executing business logic against projections and represents
the main source of business requirement fulfillment in the microservice. Like other Broadleaf
components, service components load in a deferred loader and will be ignored if another bean of
the same type is already registered. This allows for an extended service to be loaded instead of
the out-of-the-box Broadleaf service. Existing methods may be overridden, or new ones introduced.

=== Extension Example
Let's add some additional logging to denote how you may want to hook into the execution of certain
business flows. In this case, let's add some arbitrary logging in the creation flow of a `Product`.

[source,java]
----
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.repository.product.ProductRepository;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.service.product.DefaultProductService;
import com.broadleafcommerce.catalog.service.product.VariantService;
import com.broadleafcommerce.data.tracking.core.context.ContextInfo;
import com.broadleafcommerce.data.tracking.core.service.RsqlCrudEntityHelper;

import lombok.extern.apachecommons.CommonsLog;

@CommonsLog
public class TutorialProductService extends DefaultProductService {  // <1>

    public TutorialProductService(ProductRepository repository, RsqlCrudEntityHelper helper,
            VariantService variantService) {
        super(repository, helper, variantService);
    }

    @Override
    public Object create(Object businessInstance, ContextInfo context) { // <2>
        log.info("EXTENSION TUTORIAL - DEMONSTRATE EXECUTION OF CUSTOM BUSINESS LOGIC");
        return super.create(businessInstance, context);
    }
}
----
<1> Extend the framework's `DefaultProductService`
<2> Override the `create()` method, add a custom logging message, and call `super()`

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must still register your component with Spring either by component scanning or explicitly
defining the `@Bean` in your own configuration class e.g.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public ProductService<Product> customProductService(
        ProductRepository<Trackable> productRepository,
        RsqlCrudEntityHelper helper,
        VariantService<Variant> variantService) {
    return new TutorialProductService(productRepository, helper, variantService);
}
----
====

== API Endpoints

=== Overview
Broadleaf API endpoints are backed by Spring Rest Controllers.
The rest controller represents the outward facing API for the microservice. Most commonly,
this component is responsible for little more than de-serializing/serializing JSON input/output
and then passing off to a service component. Out-of-the-box rest controllers may be extended
using standard Java OOP extension. Broadleaf singleton components are annotated to conditionally
load only if a bean of their type does not already exist. And since Broadleaf components are
loaded during the autoconfiguration phase (deferred loader), their ordering is post developer
extensions. Methods may be added or overridden to accomplish new or customized endpoints.
As mentioned in the Business Domain section, Spring Converters may be registered to de-serialize
JSON into more derived business domain types upon endpoint entry. Furthermore, customization of the
JSON output can be achieved with a combination of a `JSONSerializer` implementation and the
`@JsonComponent` annotation. This provides flexibility to hide unwanted fields, modify
field name, etcâ€¦â€‹


== Putting It All Together

Now that we have all the customizations and extensions in place, let's go ahead and re-build
our application and re-start our backend services.

With the customizations above, we should:

- see our new simple property field on `Product` be manageable in the Admin
- whenever a new `Product` is created through the admin, you should see some
information logging in your console that was added in Step 4
- when you create a new `Product` and create a new `Export` job that references this new product,
the resulting CSV should also contain a new header and column with the appropriate extended field


=== Testing Endpoints Directly using cURL [Alternative]

Another alternative evaluation flow or local development flow may include being able to easily hit endpoints directly either via cURL or utilizing a tool like POSTMAN.

==== Get an AUTH Token from the Admin

In order to hit the API directly, you'll need to obtain an `AUTH` token. The broadleaf admin provides an easy utility to generate a token based on the logged in admin user.

If you log into the admin as the master user, you should see a `Developer Settings` at the section bottom of the admin nav. Clicking on this brings up a modal that allows you to turn on certain dev settings.

image::../images/MS_DevSettings.png[]

To generate an `AUTH` token, type in the appropriate scopes needed for your API call (e.g. `PRODUCT`) and click `AUTHORIZE`. Take note of this token for the next step.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note: the token generated defaults to the normal short lived TTL as with all authorization tokens (~2 mins)
====

==== Hit the Product Details Endpoint

Issue a cURL request like:

[source]
----
curl --insecure -X GET "https://localhost:8447/product-details?productUris=%2Ftest" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-Context-Request: {\"applicationId\": \"1\", \"tenantId\": \"5DF1363059675161A85F576D\" }" -H "Authorization: Bearer <COPY PASTE AUTH TOKEN>"
----
